# Nile
Linux native Amazon Games client, based on [this research](https://github.com/Lariaa/GameLauncherResearch/wiki/Amazon-Games)

Nile aims to be CLI and GUI tool for managing and playing games from Amazon. 

## Features
- Login to Amazon Account
- Download games
- Play games (with Wine/Proton on Linux)
- Play games using [Bottles](https://usebottles.com) (`--bottle` parameter)

## Might not work
- Online games, that use `FuelPump` (I don't have any game like that to test)

# Purpose
This is my attempt to make Amazon Games useful for Linux users, who want to play titles obtained thanks to [Prime](https://prime.amazon.com) membership.

# Dependencies
## Arch, Manjaro etc..
`sudo pacman -Sy pyqt5 python-pycryptodome python-zstandard python-requests python-protobuf`
## Ubuntu
`sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pycryptodome python3-requests python3-zstd`
## With pip
> Do this after cloning the repo and cd into the directory
> Do not install if you installed dependencies through your package manager

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Installation
Currently app is not packaged in any way so here are a few steps to download it:

## Setting up dev environment:

# Prior work

This is based on Rodney's work here: https://github.com/derrod/twl.py
Some of his code is implemented in nile, since nothing changed since then in terms of downloading and patching
